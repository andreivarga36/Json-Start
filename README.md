# Json.Start

  - This project provides an implementation for validating JSON numbers and strings.

  - The JsonNumber class offers functionality to verify whether a given string conforms to the JSON number format, including integers, fractions and exponents, ensuring data integrity and compatibility with JSON specifications. 
  
  - Similarly, the JsonString class provides methods to validate JSON string literals, ensuring that strings are properly formatted according to JSON standards. Also, it contains unit tests using Xunit to ensure the reliability and correctness of the validation logic.
